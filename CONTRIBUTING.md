# Contributing

This text file is for contributing code to the project.

## General Information

### Editing code

To edit the code, you will need to download the source code onto your own device. From there, in order to run the project you will need to set up a localhost server using `node server.js`.

## Test your changes

Before submitting code, make sure to run the game to make sure everything works as intended and that your changes have not affected any other unchanged sectors of the game.

## Style Conventions

- Use spaces around parentheses: `if (1 == 2) {`
- Use camel case in Javascript (e.g. `myVariable`), and hyphens in CSS and HTML (e.g. `this-is-a-header`).
- Comment where appropriate, but not too extensively. If you have what could potentially be a confusing piece of code for other programmers, either add comments or simplify the code.
- Try to keep variable names simple and short where possible.
