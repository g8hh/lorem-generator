# Contributing

This text file is for contributing code to the project.

## General Information

### Editing code

To edit the code, you will need to fork the project. From there, in order to run the project locally you will need to run a local server using `node server.js`. This is as simply opening the index.html file will not allow for the storage of cookies, which is bound to break something somewhere.

## Test your changes

Before submitting code, make sure to run the game to make sure everything works as intended, and that your changes have not negatively affected any other  sectors of the game.

## Style Conventions

- Use spaces around parentheses: `if (1 === 2) {`
- Use camel case in Javascript (e.g. `myVariable`), and hyphens in CSS and HTML (e.g. `this-is-a-header`).
- Comment where appropriate, but not too extensively. If you have what could potentially be a confusing piece of code for other programmers, either add comments or simplify the code.
- Try to keep variable and function names descriptive.
